# dot-matrix-tools - A simple tool I made for basic typesetting with dot-matrix printers

The only printer I own is the Oki ML1120 eco, so I have no idea if this is useful for any other printer. I share this without any warranty but I'm happy if it helps you.

To use the tool, simply invoke `cat your_file | ./cmd.sh`. You may need to adjust the file depending on the printers device name or encoding (it assumes WINDOWS-1250 as I use many central european characters). To get a better impression of the capabilites, feel free to study (or print) the example file.
